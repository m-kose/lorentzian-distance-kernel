This is a final project for the Data Mining class(4th year), trying to utilize the Lorentzian Distance/Lorentzian Metric in ML as a kernel. Once i have some free time, this code will transformed into a general Python package, with comments and explanations on each function. For now you can read the paper/report i wrote about it, the paper is not published on Afyon Kocatepe engineering journal(or anywhere), it was just taken and used as a template for my project's report.
